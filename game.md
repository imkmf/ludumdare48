Game idea: 
  - Conversations during the day
  - Platformer dreams at night

  - Progressing through time
    - More pixelated with time 
    - Sound dampens

    - At old age, introduce glasses/hearing aids
      - Hold button to fix video/sound temporarily

  - Dreams get more crowded
    - Young: high jumps and flying
    - Middle: obstacles and lesser jumps
    - Old: cramped

  - Ends with pixels degrading into white and black then nothing
  - Credits and then growing pixels at end (rebirth)
